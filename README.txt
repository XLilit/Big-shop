hello everyone, I'm Arman, I present to you the project MultiShop.
This is a test shop written in React. The project uses fake api requests to the server.

!!!!!!!!!!!!warning!!!!!!!!!!!

if for some reason it is not possible to send a request ''
and you get a 400 error, then I ask you to change the key in the folder
"src/connection/api/ProductApi" to a new key.
and you can get the key if you go to the site "https://crudcrud.com" .
this service gives us access to requests 100 times a day,
but this is not a hindrance to us, we can just change the key and everything will work again.
if you change the key, then the fake server will be clean,
so if itâ€™s not difficult for you, please add a product and category according to your desire

Thanks!!!!
